# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)** to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. It helps businesses understand customer behavior and target marketing strategies accordingly.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Features:** Annual Income, Spending Score
- **Target:** Identify customer segments

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📌 Features Implemented
✅ Data Preprocessing & Standardization  
✅ K-Means Clustering with Optimal Cluster Selection  
✅ Data Visualization of Customer Segments  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
```
### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
